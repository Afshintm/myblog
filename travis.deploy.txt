to deploy on travis
I needed to get a new aws key and secret key from aws website for travis user.

I had to add the following to travis.yaml file as new doco images in travis do not have c++ compiler built in for io.js
version 3+

env:
  - CXX=g++-4.8
addons:
  apt:
    sources:
      - ubuntu-toolchain-r-test
    packages:
      - g++-4.8

another addition to old travis.yml file was as follow which i added in before_deploy

- rvm 1.9.3 do gem install mime-types -v 2.6.2

as I was getting mimetype error with ruby 1.9.3


Another thing worth mentioning is that I also commented out grunt:test as angular-mock was getting undefined issue and
I had no choice but to do that


first I got access_key and secret_access_key from AWS
then I run following command in the main folder of the project giving both access_key and secret_access_key
 to obtain the secure version of the secret one in the travis.yml file

 travis setup s3


 this command will overwrite your current travis.yml


 Then I need to go to the repository setting within Travis.Org website and add 3 environment variables as follow

ARTIFACTS_KEY=(AWS access key id)
ARTIFACTS_SECRET=(AWS secret access key)
ARTIFACTS_BUCKET=(S3 bucket name)
